        In Sur Lpez Province is the Eduardo Avaroa Andean Fauna National Reserve. It is the most visited protected area in Bolivia, which is located in the extreme southwest. In the Potos Department, it is considered to be the most important protected area in terms of tourist traffic.

Spending a few days at more than 4,000 meters above sea level, in the heart of the desert, and exploring the Eduardo Avaroa Reserve in the Sur Lipez province of Bolivia means seeing incredible views every day! 

The area is home to colorful lagoons, hot springs, geysers, unusual rock formations, volcanoes, flamingos, cacti, and the famous Uyuni Salt Flat.
